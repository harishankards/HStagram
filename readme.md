# HStagram

My first app on redux experimentation. TL;DR: a ditto of instagram.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:4000> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
